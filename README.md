### What the heck is XENOTIME?

**XENOTIME** is a Rust/OpenGL-based 2D/3D game engine/platform. Its primary focuses are efficency, consistency, and immersion.

**Note:** XENOTIME is currently in its early stages. We're still laying out the first version of the design concept, so
nothing is implemented yet.

### What's with the crazy name?

It comes pretty much directly from the mineral [Xenotime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotime). It was originally a codename,
but I decided it should just be final. I chose this because it reminded me of Java's `System.nanoTime()` function, which is used
in game loops. Don't let that mislead you, though. Java isn't relevant in this case.
